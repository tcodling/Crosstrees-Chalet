      <h2>Te Whau</h2>
      <p>
        CrossTrees is situated at the end of Te Whau, a beautiful peninsula in
        the more populated western end of Waiheke Island. Te Whau Peninsula is
        known for amazing views to the northern part of the island, south over
        Tamaki Strait and back towards Auckland City. Waiheke Island is renowned
        for vineyards, olive groves, art and forest walks and all of these can
        be discovered within the Te Whau area. Enjoy a swim at high tide,
        explore the rock pools at low tide, follow the coastal walkway to
        Kuakarau Bay Forest Reserve or follow the walking route known as the Te
        Whau Loop.
      </p>
      <h2>A Short Drive</h2>
      <p>
        Within a few minutes drive is Waiheke’s main supermarket and on
        Saturdays, the famous Ostend Market. Did you know that the native
        dotterel breeding programme at nearby Whakanewha Regional Park is one of
        the most successful in New Zealand? There are some scenic walks and
        picnic spots here too. Enjoy a round at Waiheke Golf Club or take a walk
        along long, white, sandy Onetangi Beach. Visit the area known as
        Vineyard Valley including Stonyridge Vineyard, Wild on Waiheke, Te Motu
        and the award-winning Tantalus. We can also supply you with a copy of
        The Waiheke Island Art Map - A guide to studios and galleries and the
        Waiheke Island of Wine Map. To explore he eastern part of the island we
        recommend driving “The Loop Rd” leading to Waiheke's beautiful Man O War
        Vineyard.

      <h2>How to get here</h2>
      <p>
        We recommend that guests have their own transport as there is so much to
        see and do. Car ferry Sealink departs from Half Moon Bay. Fullers
        departs from Downtown Auckland Ferry Building (passengers only). If you
        arrive as a foot passenger you may want to hire a car. Once you have
        made your travel arrangements we can provide driving directions from the
        wharf. If you have never been to Waiheke before, it's easy to get around
        once you know how.
      </p>
      <h2>Make your reservation</h2>
      <p>
        Due to limited availability, particularly over the summer peak season,
        we recommend booking well in advance. Once you have made your travel
        arrangements you can relax and look forward to your holiday.

      <h1>About Us</h1>

      <p>Welcome to CrossTrees Chalet.</p>

      <p>
        We designed and built CrossTrees so visitors could experience this
        beautiful and peaceful part of the island. Guests often ask how we named
        the chalet. We love the ocean and 'crosstrees' are the beams at the top
        of the mast of huge sailing ships - the place with the best view. As
        part of that 'top of the world' feeling, Crosstrees guests look over the
        native regenerating forest (protected by a conservation covenant) to the
        water.

      <h1>How to get to Waiheke Island</h1>
      <p>
        Now that you have made your booking at CrossTrees you need to make
        arrangements to get here. There are three ferry companies to choose from
        and two main wharves. Making travel arrangements is easy once you know
        how.
      </p>
      <p>
        It really helps to have your own transport if you are here for a few
        days because the island is huge…over 90 square kilometers. Most of the
        8500 residents live towards the western end of the island but Waiheke’s
        Man O’War Vineyard - one of the islands most popular visitor attractions
        - is at the far eastern end. The vineyards and olive groves the island
        is famous for are scattered throughout. The freedom of having your own
        transport means you can explore the island at your convenience and
        easily pop down to the supermarket for supplies if needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Option 1:</strong>
        Bring Your Own Car. Of the two wharves, Kennedy Point Wharf (where the
        Sealink car ferry arrives) is closest to CrossTrees - there is a scenic
        lookout point a short walk up the road that looks directly down on the
        wharf. This is a great spot for taking photographs. Most of the car
        ferries depart from Half Moon Bay in Auckland.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the summer season, public holidays and weekends the island is
        very popular. We strongly recommend booking car ferries in advance. You
        do not need to pre-book as a passenger. You can print off a map with
        directions on how to get here from either Kennedy Point Wharf or
        Matiatia Wharf.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Option 2:</strong>
        Hire a Car. Foot passengers travel on Fullers ferry (from Downtown
        Auckland) or one of the Sealink car ferries (from Half Moon Bay,
        Auckland). There are several rental car companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Option 3:</strong>
        Bring your bike. You can take your bike on the Fullers Ferry for free. A
        high level of fitness is required as Waiheke is very hilly in parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Option 4:</strong>
        Taxi. There are several taxi companies. We strongly recommend
        pre-booking a taxi. Try Waicabs on 0800 924 222.
      </p>

        Please

        arrive. We look forward to meeting you!
