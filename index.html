      <h2>Te Whau</h2>
      <p>
        CrossTrees is situated at the end of Te Whau, a beautiful peninsula in
        the more populated western end of Waiheke Island. Te Whau Peninsula is
        known for amazing views to the northern part of the island, south over
        Tamaki Strait and back towards Auckland City. Waiheke Island is renowned
        for vineyards, olive groves, art and forest walks and all of these can
        be discovered within the Te Whau area. Enjoy a swim at high tide,
        explore the rock pools at low tide, follow the coastal walkway to
        Kuakarau Bay Forest Reserve or follow the walking route known as the Te
        Whau Loop.
      </p>
      <h2>A Short Drive</h2>
      <p>
        Within a few minutes drive is Waiheke’s main supermarket and on
        Saturdays, the famous Ostend Market. Did you know that the native
        dotterel breeding programme at nearby Whakanewha Regional Park is one of
        the most successful in New Zealand? There are some scenic walks and
        picnic spots here too. Enjoy a round at Waiheke Golf Club or take a walk
        along long, white, sandy Onetangi Beach. Visit the area known as
        Vineyard Valley including Stonyridge Vineyard, Wild on Waiheke, Te Motu
        and the newly opened Tantalus. We can also supply you with a copy of The
        Waiheke Island Art Map - A guide to studios and galleries and the
        Waiheke Island of Wine Map. To explore he eastern part of the island we
        recommend driving “The Loop Rd” leading to Waiheke's beautiful Man O War
        Vineyard.
      </p>
      <h2>Special Offer</h2>
      <p>
        Don't forget to check out our Special Offers page.
      </p>
      <h2>Gift Vouchers</h2>
      <p>
        There are a limited number of two night gift vouchers available. To find
        out more contact us.
      </p>
      <h2>How to get here</h2>
      <p>
        We recommend that guests have their own transport as there is so much to
        see and do. Car ferry Sealink departs from Half Moon Bay. Fullers
        departs from Downtown Auckland Ferry Building (passengers only). If you
        arrive as a foot passenger you may want to hire a car. Once you have
        made your travel arrangements we can provide driving directions from the
        wharf. If you have never been to Waiheke before, it's easy to get around
        once you know how.
      </p>
      <h2>Make your reservation</h2>
      <p>
        Due to limited availability, particularly over the summer peak season,
        we recommend booking well in advance. Once you have made your travel
        arrangements you can relax and look forward to your holiday.

    <!-- About Us -->
    <div id="about">
      <h1>About Us</h1>

      <p>Welcome to CrossTrees Chalet.</p>

      <p>
        We designed and built CrossTrees so visitors could experience this
        beautiful and peaceful part of the island. Guests often ask how we named
        the chalet. We love the ocean and 'crosstrees' are the beams at the top
        of the mast of huge sailing ships - the place with the best view. As
        part of that 'top of the world' feeling, Crosstrees guests look over the
        native regenerating forest (protected by a conservation covenant) to the
        water.
